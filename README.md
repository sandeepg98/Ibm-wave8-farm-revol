**FarmRevol IBM Wave 8**


The traditional farming approach in our country is not enough to provide us  quality food because knowledge and source are not being provided to the farmers in our country.

Consumer needs quality food but our system is not able to maintain quality and safety standards as per requirement. A high dose of pesticides and urea in food is becoming a national health concern.

 On the other hand, most farmers being ignorant of existing policies and technologies, finally end up being victims of the existing unorganized supply chain with middlemen squeezing farmers to increase margins.
 
What is needed is a technology-enabled solution to help out Indian farmers and consumers to join hands to produce and consume quality food products while increasing the profitability of farmers.

FarmRevol is a farm aggregator platform where farmers can offer part/whole agricultural land to consumers on rent. 
Farmers cultivate organic food and vegetables.

Consumers can take on rent one or more farms to receive the end products cultivated there
